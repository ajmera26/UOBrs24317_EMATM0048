The additional libraries used in the provided code, other than the standard Python libraries, are:

pandas: Used for handling and manipulating the dataset in DataFrame format.
seaborn: Used for creating advanced visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, violin plots, and heatmaps.
matplotlib: Used for creating basic plots (e.g., scatter plots, line plots).
scipy: Specifically, the pearsonr function is used to compute the Pearson correlation coefficient.
sklearn (Scikit-learn): Used for creating linear regression models, splitting data into training/testing sets, and evaluating the models (via metrics like RÂ² and MSE).


To install the required libraries for your Python environment, you can use the following pip command:

pip install requests pandas seaborn matplotlib scipy scikit-learn

This command will install:

requests - For making HTTP requests to fetch the COVID-19 data from the API.
pandas - For handling and manipulating the data in DataFrame format.
seaborn - For advanced data visualization, especially for statistical plots.
matplotlib - For basic plotting and visualizations.
scipy - For statistical analysis, such as correlation tests.
scikit-learn - For machine learning tasks, including regression modeling.
If using a Jupyter notebook, you can install these directly within the notebook by running:

!pip install requests pandas seaborn matplotlib scipy scikit-learn

Make sure to run this in your terminal or Jupyter environment to install the necessary packages.
